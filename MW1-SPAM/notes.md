Possible continuation:
  1. Run code on stronger machine such as, cuda or taylor
  (I will assume the code is correctm as from what I seen)
  2. Edit code to classes
  3. Give it my dataset (input mails)


Todo - dodelky:
  1. train_filter only 2 arg.
  2. upravit document params, opoopo


Naplnit params a popsat parametry v dokumentu.
Najit best solution.
